## This Project is mainly me coding for me in ways that are VERY specific. You will likely have to customise this project quite a bit for it to even run not even talking about making it useful for you! Keep in mind that this app will probably be under constant work etc. â†’ Breaking Changes

I have been working on adding Support for Notifications.

The Notifications sent over Googles Firebase are Encrypted. However the Server receives them in cleartext and reads them
as such. If you want you may add Code for Encryption on your side. I decided against it since making it end to end
encrypted means that I would have to encrypt the data for each client individually or its a pain to sync across devices.

Keep in mind that over the Default Server that I host you may not send encypted data. If someone sends a significant
amount of requests I want to know why and might block you otherwise. Also a bit curious yk. If you want to do sensetive
Stuff host it yourself.

All rights reserved.

for now though:

- you cant sell a copy of your app etc based on this project in any way.
- it has to be a fork (so i can check yours out too etc)
- I get the right to pull anything you change or implement into this "official" version.
- you have to use a public fork on github (with source code etc) with no exclusions aside from the things that need to
  be sensitive aka private configurations etc, but in such cases those classes have to minimised.
- if you have credits anywhere you need to mention this project.
- you need to react within 1 month of a tried contact.
- i have the right to request a deletion of your fork. (if i find it abusive, ...)
- you can not be active in the Enchanted Redstone Lamp market. If you look at the Sources you will know why.
