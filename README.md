## This Project is mainly me coding for me in ways that are VERY specific. You will likely have to customise this project quite a bit for it to even run not even talking about making it useful for you! Keep in mind that this app will probably be under constant work etc.


All rights reserved.

for now though:
- you cant sell a copy of your app etc based on this project in any way.
- it has to be a fork (so i can check yours out too etc)
- I get the right to pull anything you change or implement into this "official" version.
- you have to use a public fork on github (with source code etc) with no exclusions aside from the things that need to be sensitive aka private configurations etc, but in such cases those classes have to minimised.
- if you have credits anywhere you need to mention this project.
- you need to react within 1 month of a tried contact.
- i have the right to request a deletion of your fork. (if i find it abusive, ...)
- you can not be active in the Enchanted Redstone Lamp market. If you look at the Sources you will know why.
